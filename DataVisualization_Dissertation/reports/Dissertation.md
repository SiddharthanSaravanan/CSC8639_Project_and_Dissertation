# 1 Introduction

Over the last few years, air pollution in urban areas has steadily increased. The air is becoming increasingly harmful at an alarming rate as a result of growing industrialization and rising levels of harmful chemicals in the atmosphere. Since the outbreak of the Coronavirus pandemic, it has become more important to limit air pollution in order to mitigate the virus's effects. According to the WHO, 91% of the world population is breathing polluted air, which is one of the leading factors in the development of non-infectious disease. The UK Government through the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) manages the Ambient Air Quality by controlling the source of emission and by monitoring and managing the air quality.

Urban observatories have been established in several locations around the United Kingdom as a result of rapid technology advancements in IoT and sensor development. These urban observatories collect vital data about their community on a variety of topics, from air quality to traffic tracking, where environmental and human-caused data is gathered, stored, and evaluated for a variety of purposes. The number of topics and focus themes vary according on the locations and observatories. Manchester Urban Observatory [1] and Newcastle Urban Observatory [2] are two of the most active observatories in the United Kingdom that are being considered for this project. Despite the fact that both observatories have a few shared elements, this study considers air quality data collected by sensors in both locations.

Sensors with an Air Quality theme collects the data on characteristics that can be used to determine the location's air quality. Multiple sensors have been deployed across the city, and data is collected continuously 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The data observatories records the gases emissions and substances that are toxic for human beings. The most harmful emissions that are recorded through the sensors are tropospheric ozone (O_3), sulpher dioxide (SO_2), nitrogen dioxide (NO_2), Benzene, suspended particulate matter (PM_2.5 and PM_10), Lead, Carbon monoxide, PAH and 1,3-Butadiene. These are the Target Essential Variables (EV) established as the UK Government's National Air Quality Strategy (NAQS).

## 1.1 Project Objectives

The goal of this research is to compare, visually represent and predict the Air Quality of Manchester and Newcastle upon Tyne using data from their respective Urban Observatories. The EV's as established by Defra, only the Suspended Particulate Matter PM_10 and Nitrogen Dioxide NO_2 are considered as part of this research.  

More specifically the objective of the project includes:
* Data preparation and visual analysis of air quality data collected over a two-month period in Manchester and Newcastle upon Tyne.
* Comparing the variations and findings in air quality over time.
* Extend the data from two months to two years to better understand the impact of COVID19 on air quality â€” before lockdown, during lockdown-1, after lockdown-1, during lockdown-2, after lockdown-2.
* Analyze the data as a time series to better identify seasonality trends and extend the analysis to 
forecasting air quality data.

## 3.1 Data Analysis

### 3.1.1 Data Understanding

The Air Quality data of both Manchester and Newcastle city are available for public use in their respective Urban Observatories. The Newcastle Urban Observatory monitors and records the data at the minutes granularity, whereas the Manchester Ubran Observatory monitors and records the data at 5-minute granularity. Further the Newcastle Urban Observatory has the feature of accessing the dataset through API's whereas the data for Manchester city should be manually downloaded from the Manchester Urban Observatory. 

The Manchester city data have been downloaded manually from the Manchester Urban Observatory portal and postcodes for each sensor in the city is manually updated as part of the data preparation. The final data after data preparation step consists of 5 variables.

Table: Dataset description of Manchester

| **Variable Name** | **Class** | **Information**                            |
|-------------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------|
| Timestamp         | Character | Time series of the data recorded           |
| NO2               | Numeric   | Value of the sensor recorded               |
| PM10              | Numeric   | Value of the sensor recorded               |
| StationName       | Character | Station name which the sensor is located   |
| PostCodes         | Character | Location of the sensor                     |

The Newcastle city data have been downloaded from the Newcastle Urban Observatory portal through API. The final data after data preparation step consists of 5 variables.

Table: Dataset description of Newcastle

| **Variable Name** | **Class** | **Information**                            |
|-------------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------|
| Sensor.Name       | Character | The name of the sensor which records data  |
| Variable          | Character | The Essential Variables from the data      |
| Timestamp         | Character | Time series of the data recorded           |
| Value             | Numeric   | Value of the EV's recorded                 |
| Location..WKT.    | Character | Location of the sensor                     |

### 3.1.2 Data Preparation

The R has been used predominantly for pre-processing the data through the Project Template Package. During the initial stages of the research, February month's data of the year 2020 is considered and the time period is expanded after completing the data pipeline for the analysis. The Manchester city data has been downloaded manually and the data is stored as separate files based on each station location. The postcodes of each station was manually updated which helps in the future analysis process. The dataset has been binded together as a single data file using Python. The combined dataset have been stored inside the data folder of the R's Project Template. 

The Newcastle data has been downloaded through the API from Newcastle Urban Observatory portal and the dataset has been stored in the data folder of the Project Template. Both the cities dataset has been wrangled by removing the N/A values. The data has been pre-processed by assigning valid data types for the variables, conversion of postcodes into Latitude and Longitude for geospatial visualization of the EV's concentrations. The variable Timestamp of both the dataset was in text format and hence they are converted into date format and new variables "date" and "hour" has be obtained from the Timestamp variable.

### 3.1.3 Visual Representation

The datasets obtained from the step 3.1.2 has been stored in a way such that one file holds the NO2 concentration among Newcastle and Manchester city and one file holds the PM10 concentration among Newcastle and Manchester city. Tableau has been extensively used for visual representation by creating dashboards. The visualization has been generated by three different granularity level which helps to better understand and visually view the outcome in each each cities.

![Visualisation on Daily Granularity of NO_2](NO2_Daily.png){ width=95%, height=30% }

Since the visualization of hourly granularity depicts that there are some fluctuations in some weeks, the granularity is increased by aggregating on a daily basis to visually view the fluctuations on the daily average concentration. The **Figure 3** represents the visualization based on Daily granularity of NO_2 concentration between the cities.


![Visualisation on Daily Granularity of PM_10](PM10_Daily.png){ width=95%, height=30% }

The **Figure 4** represents the visualization generated based on Daily granularity of PM_10 concentration between the cities.
\newpage

![Visualisation on weekly Granularity of NO_2](NO2_Weekly.png){ width=95%, height=30% }

The **Figure 5** represents the weekly granularity of the NO_2 concentration. The values are aggregated based on the weekly basis and are represented in different colors for each city.

![Visualisation on weekly Granularity of PM_10](PM10_Weekly.png){ width=95%, height=30% }

The **Figure 6** represents the visualization generated based on Weekly granularity of PM_10 concentration between the cities.

### 3.1.3 Statistical Analysis
